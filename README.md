# CETAPP
Developing a social networking platform with E-learning system named CETAPP for the department will help to solve the problem of anti-socialism and some of the limitations being suffered in the teaching and learning process. A social network is referred to as a social structure made up of individuals (or organizations) called “nodes”, which are connected by one or more specific types of interdependency, such as friendship, kinship, common interest, financial exchange, dislike, or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. The name CETAPP chosen for this project is an acronym which stands for Computer Engineering Technology Application(i.e web app).
